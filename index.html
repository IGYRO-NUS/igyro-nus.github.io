                    <h5>Keynote Title</h5>
                    <p>Legal and policy choices in making platforms liable for mis, dis, and mal-information</p>
                    <h5>Keynote Abstract</h5>
                    <p>Law is only one part of the response to the risks of harm to individuals and society from online mis, dis, and mal information. Indeed, law may be a last line of defence coming after other initiatives to improve information resilience. Nonetheless, law has an important role in setting the boundaries for the information environment and supporting the dissemination of trustworthy information online. Increasingly, laws concerned with the information environment are not only aimed at transgressing individuals but at digital platforms, as the intermediaries of harmful information. Digital platforms are accessible as a regulatory target and moreover play a role in disseminating and amplifying harmful information. There are complex policy choices in deciding what to regulate and questions of ‘regulatory design’ in deciding how to tackle the information responsibilities of digital platforms, including through ex ante obligations and ex post liabilities. This talk will explore these issues with reference to regulatory initiatives in Singapore, Australia and the UK. It will compare approaches to Online Safety, marketing misinformation and misleading electoral communications, as well as considering how online ‘harm’ is itself is understood and the role of transparency in responding to mis, dis and mal-information concerns.</p>

                  <p>Political Polarization Versus Veracity and Congruence as a Determinant of Believing and Sharing the News</p>
                  <h5>Oral Abstract</h5>
                  <p>The research investigates the relationship between politically oriented news and the inclination of readers to share it with others.  It explores how the veracity of a news headline and its alignment with a reader's political beliefs influence their decision to share it, mainly focusing on the differences between Democrat and Republican voters.  We conducted a preregistered study with a between-subject design (Sender sample N= 2,200, Receiver sample N= 740) of a U.S. representative sample. The study uses a controlled experiment where participants are presented with various news headlines that are either true or fake and congruent or incongruent with their political views.  The participants are then asked if they would share the headline with another participant and how much money they would be willing to accept for doing so. The study found that the veracity of a headline is a more significant factor in the decision to share than its political congruence.  Both Democrats and Republicans were more willing to share true headlines that were incongruent with their political views than fake headlines that were congruent. However, the study also found that Republicans were more willing to share fake, congruent news than Democrats.</p>

                  <p>Twitter Users' Sharing Behaviour Across Different Information Categories During the U.S. Election</p>
                  <h5>Oral Abstract</h5>
                  <p>This paper investigates the key features that influence the popularity of U.S. presidential candidates' Twitter posts, measured by likes and shares, during election periods. Employing machine learning techniques, we analyze data from the 2016, 2020, and 2024 U.S. presidential elections, focusing on four candidates: Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris. To enhance the robustness of our analysis, we include Twitter posts from two prominent public figures, Barack Obama and Elon Musk.  
                    Our dataset comprises approximately 10,000 tweets collected via web scraping from 2015 to 2024 across the six individuals' official Twitter accounts. We utilize OpenAI's API for content categorization, classifying each tweet into 15 distinct categories. These categories include the presence of numerical data, references to news sources, and mentions of key policy issues such as abortion, border security and immigration, and inflation and living costs, among others.
                    By integrating machine learning models with detailed content categorization, this study aims to identify the characteristics of political messaging that drive user engagement on social media platforms. Our findings contribute to understanding how political communication strategies evolve across election cycles and how specific content features can amplify a candidate's online influence.

                  <p>Diffusion Facial Forgery Detection</p>
                  <h5>Oral Abstract</h5>
                  <p>Detecting diffusion-generated images has recently developed as an emerging research area. Existing diffusion-based datasets predominantly focus on general image generation. However, facial forgeries, which pose severe social risks, have remained less explored thus far. To address this gap, this paper introduces DiFF, a comprehensive dataset dedicated to face-focused diffusion-generated images. DiFF comprises over 500,000 images that are synthesized using thirteen distinct generation methods under four conditions. In particular, this dataset utilizes 30,000 carefully collected textual and visual prompts, ensuring the synthesis of images with both high fidelity and semantic consistency. We conduct extensive experiments on the DiFF dataset via human subject tests and several representative forgery detection methods. The results demonstrate that the binary detection accuracies of both human observers and automated detectors often fall below 30%, revealing insights on the challenges in detecting diffusion-generated facial forgeries. Moreover, our experiments demonstrate that DiFF, compared to previous facial forgery datasets, contains a more diverse and realistic range of forgeries, showcasing its potential to aid in the development of more generalized detectors. Finally, we propose an edge graph regularization approach to effectively enhance the generalization capability of existing detectors.</p>

                  <h5>Oral Abstract</h5>
                  <p>Misinformation is a prevalent societal issue due to its potential high risks. Out-of-context (OOC) misinformation, where authentic images are repurposed with false text, is one of the easiest and most effective ways to mislead audiences. Current methods focus on assessing image-text consistency but lack convincing explanations for their judgments, which is essential for debunking misinformation. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rich knowledge and innate capability for visual reasoning and explanation generation, they still lack sophistication in understanding and discovering the subtle crossmodal differences. SNIFFER is a novel multimodal large language model specifically engineered for OOC misinformation detection and explanation. SNIFFER employs two-stage instruction tuning on InstructBLIP. SNIFFER not only detects inconsistencies between text and image but also utilizes external knowledge for contextual verification. Our experiments show that SNIFFER surpasses the original MLLM by over 40% and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy. SNIFFER also provides accurate and persuasive explanations as validated by quantitative and human evaluations.</p>

                  <p>The Misapprehension of Online Harm Remedies in Misinformation and Disinformation</p>
                  <h5>Oral Abstract</h5>
                  <p>The rapid proliferation of misinformation and disinformation in the digital age poses significant challenges for legal systems worldwide, yet current legal frameworks often fail to address these online harms adequately. This paper presents a qualitative analysis of legislative responses to misinformation and disinformation, focusing on the severity and efficacy of imposed punishments. Through a comparative examination of various countries' legal approaches—ranging from censorship and hefty fines to content removal and imprisonment—the study highlights a spectrum of punitive measures to curb the spread of false information. Despite the stringent nature of these laws, our analysis reveals that their effectiveness in reducing misinformation and disinformation's dissemination remains questionable. By evaluating the balance between the severity of penalties and their impact on the prevalence of online falsehoods, this paper aims to provide insights into the alignment (or lack thereof) between legislative remedies and the real-world harm caused by misinformation and disinformation. The findings underscore the need for more nuanced and effective legal strategies to address harmful online information’s complex and evolving nature.</p>

                  <p>The Paradox of Women’s Digital Wellbeing on Reddit</p>
                  <h5>Oral Abstract</h5>
                  <p>In this ever evolving digital landscape, both risks and opportunities abound and take on different forms. This paradox is apparent in women’s digital wellbeing, where the same features can facilitate both the suppression and uplifting of women. On one hand, online spaces and digital affordances facilitate online misogyny, patriarchy and the radicalisation of disenfranchised men, and technology facilitated (sexual) violence against women. On the other hand, online spaces and digital affordances can empower women and girls, allowing them to reclaim space, build resilience, support each other through sharing and seeking advice. In this project, we analyse the posts and comments from three (women only) subreddits, and apply the Digital Wellbeing Indicator Framework (DWIF). The five domains of digital life that underpin digital wellbeing, as scaffolded by the DWIF, are varyingly salient in online discussions in these subreddits; the empowerment driven largely by women themselves. </p>
